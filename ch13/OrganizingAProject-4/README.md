# Exercise: OrganizingAProject-1
(Tricky) Before reading the next section, see if you can write the code to format the data into columns, like the sample output at the start of the chapter. This is probably the longest piece of Elixir code you'll have written. Try to do it without using *if* or *cond*.

## Solution
See the `./issues` directory for the mix project containing the solution.
