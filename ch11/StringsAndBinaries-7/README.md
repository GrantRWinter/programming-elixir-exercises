# Exercise: StringsAndBinaries-7
Chapter 7, *Lists and Recursion*, on page 61, had an exercise about calculating sales tax on page 104. We now have the sales information in a file of comma-separated *id*, *ship_to*, and *amount* values. The file looks like this:

```
id,ship_to,net_amount
123,:NC,100.00
124,:OK,35.50
125,:TX,35.50
126,:TX,35.50
127,:OK,35.50
128,:OK,35.50
129,:OK,35.50
120,:OK,35.50
```
